# Bookshop_Inventory_System  
*A bookshop keeps the inventory of the books that are available for purchase. The list includes information such as the author's name, title, price, publisher, and stock position. When a customer requests a book, the salesperson enters the title and author, and the system scans the list to see if it is available. If it is not, a suitable notice is displayed. If it is, the system displays the book information and requests the number of copies needed. If the requested copies are book specifics and requests for the quantity of copies needed. If the requested copies are in stock, the total cost is presented; otherwise, the message "Required copies not in stock" is displayed. The bookshop inventory system project in C++ is designed to help bookshop owners manage their inventory efficiently. This project involves creating a program that allows users to add, modify, and delete books from the inventory. It also includes features such as searching for books by title or author, displaying the available stock of books, and generating reports on sales and inventory.*
